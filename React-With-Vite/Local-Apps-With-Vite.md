# Local React Apps With Vite

- Vite sets up a basic developer environment for us by using NPM create vite@latest
- Then it will ask us a project name, then which framework we would like to use
                npm create vite@latest
                cd into the react folder
                npm install
                npm run dev

- Create React App
    - A way to quickly set up React for our screen, but it's better to just use Vite
