# How We Should Structure Our React Apps
    - Introducing the Lucky 7 Dice Game! 
    - Helps us structure our applications to make them easier to understand

- Formulating Our Component Gameplan!
    - We can make a Component Hierarchy
    - We are unable to pass State upward, only down

- State Design Principle 
    - Lift state as high as needed, but no higher

- Decoupling Logic from presentation
    - Generally, aim to have components be one of 2 types: 
        - Presentational: Doesn't have state; is primarily about appearance/UI
        - Logical: Has state or related logic; isn't about a specific UI
